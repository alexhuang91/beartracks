-# clerks USUALLY work at the same unit
-# Do we care about security enough? Clerks can see everything, but it defaults to their normal unit (or previous unit)
-# keep track of all changes to packages
-# TODO Ask them if tracking number should be autogenerated or input--> they like doing generated by the clerk...
-#
-# add a field for the tracking number, make it searchable
-# might keep the internal tracking number to the computer INTERNAL
-# Still talking about generating package number sign sheet
-# if
-#
-#did we ever email things out?
-#active printing so that when a page is full to be printed, it is printed and only then will the package notification go out for everyoen on that page
-#
-# should we send a slip to where the package is going or where starrez says the person lives?
-# starrez is the all knowing entity, the package gets sent over to the correct unit for the person
-# package does not go into the system until it has been rerouted
